## Textbooks

_Recommended textbooks_:
In addition to the lecture notes, we recommend the books of Bishop and Goodfellow et al. 
- Christopher M. Bishop, Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, Springer, https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387310732. Chapters 1-7, 11 and 12 are the most relevant. If you login to your University Library or access this site via a University IP number, you can download for free the textbook in PDF format or epub format.
- Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. The different chapters are available for free at https://www.deeplearningbook.org/. Chapters 2-14 are highly recommended. 
_Additional textbooks_:
- Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jerome H. Friedman, The Elements of Statistical Learning, Springer, https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387848570. This is a well-known text and serves as additional literature.
- Aurelien Geron, Hands‑On Machine Learning with Scikit‑Learn and TensorFlow, O'Reilly, https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/. This text is very useful since it contains many code examples and hands-on applications of all algorithms discussed in this course.
